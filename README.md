## 1. What is Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br>
Git has many advantages, it is used to track changes in the source code and it allows multiple developers to work together. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

## 2. What is GitHub

GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – like writing books.
Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

## 5. Git Init

This is basically performed to initialise a folder/repository so as to perform git operations like adding, committing etc.<br>
Inorder to initialise local repositry with git we can run the following command to the respective folder location using terminal.<br>
      ```
      git init
      ```<br>

## 11. Git Checkout

## 12. Git log

## 13. Git status

## 14. Git merge

## 15. Git clone

This feature helps us to create a copy of an existing project from github  in our local machine. <br>
By doing so we can try out new aditional features which can help the project work in a better way, see the output of a code, to view the source code of the project etc.<br>
The command to be used is :<br>
```git clone REPOSITORY_URL``` <br>
This "REPOSITORY_URL" can be copied from the url tab of the repective repository or by simply clicking that "code" button they provide us with the copy button.<br>
