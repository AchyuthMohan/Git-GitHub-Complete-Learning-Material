## 1. What is Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br>
Git has many advantages, it is used to track changes in the source code and it allows multiple developers to work together. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

## 2. What is GitHub

GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – like writing books.
Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

## 5. Git Init

This is basically performed to initialise a folder/repository so as to perform git operations like adding, committing etc.<br>
Inorder to initialise local repositry with git we can run the following command to the respective folder location using terminal:<br>

```git init```<br>
      
press enter...<br>
Great... now your local repository has been initialized with git.

## 6. Git add

## 7. Git commit 

## 8. Git remote

## 9. Git push

## 10. Git branch

## 11. Git Checkout

The Git Checkout command is used to switch between branches in a repository.<br>
This command is used to switch from one branch to another:<br>

```git checkout branch_name```    <br>

This command creates a new branch and also switches to it:<br>

```git checkout -b branch_name```   

## 12. Git log

Git log is a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository. Generally, the git log is a record of commits.<br>

```git log```    <br>

This command will display the last commits.

## 13. Git status

## 14. Git merge

## 15. Git clone

## 16. GitHub Fork

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.<br>
Once you have forked a repo, you own your forked copy. This means that you can edit the contents of your forked repository without impacting the parent repo.<br>
You can fork any repo by clicking the fork button in the upper right hand corner of a repo page.

## 17. Git pull

The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from the tracking remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.<br>
The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge<br>
The command used to pull recent commits from the tracking remote branch is:<br><br>
```git pull origin BRANCH_NAME``` <br>
BRANCH_NAME is the name of the branch to which pull function has to be done

## 18. Pull request

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.<br>
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.<br>
To create a pull request:<br>
1. Make your changes in the forked repository/new branch in the same repository<br>
2. Push the changes back to your repo<br>
3. Click the Compare & pull request button<br>
4. Click Create pull request to open a new pull request<br>

## 19. Merge Pull request

Merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed. Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge.<br>
To merge a pull request:<br>
1. Under your repository name, click Pull requests.<br>
2. In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request you'd like to merge.<br>
3. Choose the merge options for your repository.<br>
4. If prompted, type a commit message, or accept the default message.<br>
5. Click Confirm merge.<br>
6. Optionally, delete the branch. This keeps the list of branches in your repository tidy.
